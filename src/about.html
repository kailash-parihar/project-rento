            <h1>About Us</h1>
            <p>Welcome to <strong>Rento.Com</strong>!</p>

            <p>I am <strong>Kailash Parihar</strong>, a Full Stack Web Developer and a BCA (Bachelor of Computer
                Applications) student.
                My goal is to present information about programming and technology in a simple and understandable way in
                Hindi.</p>

            <p>On <strong>Rento.Com</strong>, I write blog posts on various topics related to programming languages,
                coding notes,
                and technology. My aim is to promote knowledge about programming and technology in Hindi language and
                provide
                support to new programmers and developers.</p>

            <p>I believe that presenting information about programming and technology in a simple and understandable way
                can
                help the youth of our country fulfill their dreams. I started Coading Notes to share my experience and
                knowledge,
                so that others can also move forward in the field of programming and technology.</p>

            <p>My journey began as a student where I pursued <strong>BCA</strong> and developed an interest in
                programming. I studied
                various programming languages and technologies and worked on projects to apply my knowledge in a
                practical way.</p>

            <p>Now, I want to share my knowledge and experience through <strong>Rento</strong> to help other
                people to move
                ahead in the field of programming and technology.</p>

            <p>Thank you!</p>
